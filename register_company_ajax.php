A beta test agreement establishes two primary promises between the user and the company. First, the user will maintain a level confidentiality in their use of the product. Second, the user disclaims liability arising from the product and understands that the product could be inferior or may not function properly because it is a "beta" product. 

Beta Test Agreement
This Beta Test Agreement (“Agreement”) governs the disclosure of information by GamerStack (“Company”) to You (the “Recipient”) and Recipient’s use of Company’s beta service offering.
1.               Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, Company grants Recipient a nonexclusive, nontransferable license to use the Company service (“Service”) for a period designated by the Company for the purpose of testing and evaluating the Service.    
2.               The Recipient agrees that it will at all times will hold in strict confidence and not disclose Confidential Information (as defined below) to any third party except as approved in writing by the Company and will use the Confidential Information for no purpose other than evaluating the Service. The Recipient shall only permit access to Confidential Information to those of its employees having a need to know and who have signed confidentiality agreements or are otherwise bound by confidentiality obligations at least as restrictive as those contained herein. “Confidential Information” means all non-public materials and information provided or made available by Company to Recipient, including products and services, information regarding technology, know-how, processes, software programs, research, development, financial information and information the Company provides regarding third parties. 
3.               The Recipient’s obligations under this Agreement with respect to any portion of the Confidential Information shall terminate when the Recipient can document that: (a) it was in the public domain at the time it was communicated to the Recipient; (b) it entered the public domain subsequent to the time it was communicated to the Recipient through no fault of the Recipient; (c) it was in the Recipient’s possession free of any obligation of confidence at the time it was communicated to the Recipient; (d) it was rightfully communicated to the Recipient free of any obligation of confidence subsequent to the time it was communicated to the Recipient; or (e) it was developed by employees or agents of the Recipient who had no access to any information communicated to the Recipient. After Recipient’s evaluation of the Service is complete, or upon request of the Company, the Recipient shall promptly return to the Company all documents, notes and other tangible materials and return or certify the destruction of all electronic documents, notes, software, data, and other materials in electronic form representing the Confidential Information and all copies thereof.
4.               The Recipient agrees that nothing contained in this Agreement shall be construed as granting any ownership rights to any Confidential Information disclosed pursuant to this Agreement, or to any invention or any patent, copyright, trademark, or other intellectual property right.  The Recipient shall not make, have made, use or sell for any purpose any product or other item using, incorporating or derived from any Confidential Information or the Service.  The Recipient will not modify, reverse engineer, decompile, create other works from, or disassemble any software programs contained in the Confidential Information or the Service.
5.               This Service is a beta release offering and is not at the level of performance of a commercially available product offering.  The Service may not operate correctly and may be substantially modified prior to first commercial release, or at Company’s option may not be released commercially in the future.  THE SERVICE AND DOCUMENTATION ARE PROVIDED “AS IS” WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, AND COMPANY AND ITS LICENSORS DISCLAIM ALL WARRANTIES, EXPRESS, IMPLIED, OR STATUTORY, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION ANY IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT OF THIRD PARTY RIGHTS, MERCHANTABILITY, OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  NO ORAL OR WRITTEN ADVICE OR CONSULTATION GIVEN BY COMPANY, ITS AGENTS OR EMPLOYEES WILL IN ANY WAY GIVE RISE TO A WARRANTY.  THE ENTIRE RISK ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR PERFORMANCE OF THE SERVICE REMAINS WITH RECIPIENT. 
6.               COMPANY AND ITS LICENSORS SHALL NOT BE LIABLE FOR LOSS OF USE, LOST PROFIT, COST OF COVER, LOSS OF DATA, BUSINESS INTERRUPTION, OR ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE, SPECIAL, OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THE SERVICE OR THIS AGREEMENT, HOWEVER CAUSED AND REGARDLESS OF THE FORM OF ACTION, WHETHER IN CONTRACT, TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE) STRICT LIABILITY, OR OTHERWISE, EVEN IF SUCH PARTIES HAVE BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.  IN NO EVENT WILL COMPANY’S AGGREGATE CUMULATIVE LIABILITY FOR ANY CLAIMS ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THIS AGREEMENT EXCEED $50.00 OR THE AMOUNT RECIPIENT ACTUALLY PAID COMPANY UNDER THIS AGREEMENT (IF ANY).
7.               The Recipient’s obligations under this Agreement shall survive any termination of this agreement. This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of California. The Recipient hereby agrees that breach of this Agreement will cause Company irreparable damage for which recovery of damages would be inadequate, and that the Company shall therefore be entitled to obtain timely injunctive relief under this Agreement, as well as such further relief as may be granted by a court of competent jurisdiction.  The Recipient will not assign or transfer any rights or obligations under this Agreement without the prior written consent of the Company.
In Witness Whereof, the Recipient has caused this Agreement to be executed as of the date set upon “Registration” for this beta testing.

A mutual non-disclosure agreement (NDA) is a legal contract between at least two parties that outlines confidential material, knowledge, or information that the parties wish to share with one another for purposes of a potential or actual business relationship, but wish to restrict access to or by third parties. As such, an NDA protects nonpublic business information.

This Agreement, dated as of the moment You have clicked the ‘Register’, ‘Sign Up’, ‘Log In’, or any similar ways to access GamerStack and any related material (the “Effective Date”), governs the disclosure of information by and between You (“Tester”)and GamerStack (the "Company") for the purpose of persuing a business relationship.
1.               As used herein, “Confidential Information” shall mean any and all technical and non-technical information provided by either party to the other that is marked or otherwise identified at the time of disclosure as confidential or proprietary, whether in graphic, electronic, written or oral form, and including but not limited to any ideas, techniques, drawings, designs, descriptions, specifications, works of authorship, patent applications or other filings, models, inventions, know-how, processes, algorithms, software source documents, and formulae related to the current, future, and proposed technologies, products and services of each of the parties, and also any information concerning research, experimental work, development, financial information, purchasing, customer lists, investors, employees, business and contractual relationships, business forecasts, business plans, proprietary information, personally-identifiable information, sales and merchandising, marketing plans of or related to the disclosing Party and information the disclosing Party provides regarding or belonging to third parties.  For oral disclosures to constitute “Confidential Information,” such disclosures must be identified at the time as confidential or proprietary and the disclosing Party must provide a written summary of the Confidential Information within thirty (30) days following initial disclosure. 
2.               Each party agrees that at all times and notwithstanding any termination or expiration of this Agreement it will hold in strict confidence and not disclose to any third party Confidential Information of the party disclosing the Confidential Information (the “Disclosing Party”), except as approved in writing by the Disclosing Party, and will use the Confidential Information for no purpose other than the Purpose.  Notwithstanding any of the foregoing, the party to whom Confidential Information was disclosed (the “Recipient”) shall not be in violation of this Section 2 with regard to a disclosure that was in response to a valid order by a court or other governmental body, provided that the Recipient provides the Disclosing Party with prior written notice of such disclosure in order to permit the Disclosing Party to seek confidential treatment of such information.  Each party shall only permit access to Confidential Information of the other party to those of its employees or authorized representatives having a need to know and who have signed confidentiality agreements or are otherwise bound by confidentiality obligations at least as restrictive as those contained herein.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, Tester may disclose Company Confidential Information to any of Tester's subsidiaries or affiliates, and the employees or authorized representatives of Tester’s subsidiaries or affiliates. Each party shall immediately notify the other upon discovery of any loss or unauthorized disclosure of the Confidential Information of the other party.
3.               Each party’s obligations under this Agreement with respect to any portion of the other party’s Confidential Information shall terminate when the Recipient can document that such information: (a) was in the public domain at the time it was communicated to the Recipient by the Disclosing Party through no breach of an obligation of confidentiality to the Disclosing Party; (b) entered the public domain subsequent to the time it was communicated to the Recipient by the Disclosing Party through no fault of the Recipient or other breach of an obligation of confidentiality to the Disclosing Party; (c) was in the Recipient’s possession free of any obligation of confidence at the time it was communicated to the Recipient; or (d) was developed by employees or agents of the Recipient independently of and without reference to any information communicated to the Recipient by the Disclosing Party.
4.               All Confidential Information is provided “AS IS,” without any warranty of any kind.  The parties recognize and agree that except as expressly set forth in Section 5 below, nothing contained in this Agreement shall be construed as granting any property rights, by license or otherwise, to any Confidential Information of the other party disclosed pursuant to this Agreement, or to any invention or any patent, copyright, trademark, or other intellectual property right that has issued or that may issue, based on such Confidential Information.  Neither party shall make, have made, use or sell for any purpose any product or service or other item using, incorporating or derived from any Confidential Information of the other party absent separate written agreement.
5.               Confidential Information shall not be reproduced in any form except as required to accomplish the purpose of this Agreement.  Any reproduction of any Confidential Information of the other party by either party shall remain the property of the Disclosing Party and shall contain any and all confidential or proprietary notices or legends which appear on the original, unless otherwise authorized in writing by the other party.
6.               This Agreement shall expire three years after the Effective Date, or may be terminated by either party at any time upon thirty (30) days written notice to the other party; provided, however, the Recipient’s obligations under this Agreement shall survive termination of the Agreement for a period of five (5) years and shall be binding upon the Recipient’s heirs, successors and assigns.  Upon termination or expiration of the Agreement, or upon written request of the Disclosing Party, the Recipient shall promptly return to the Disclosing Party all documents and other tangible materials representing the Disclosing Party’s Confidential Information and all copies thereof.
7.               This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of Delaware without reference to conflict of laws principles. This Agreement sets forth the complete, exclusive and final statement of the agreement between the parties as to the subject matter hereof and supersedes all prior and contemporaneous agreements, understandings, negotiations and discussions, whether oral or written, between the parties regarding such subject matter.  This Agreement may not be amended except by a writing signed by both parties hereto.  If any provision of this Agreement is found by a proper authority to be unenforceable or invalid such unenforceability or invalidity shall not render this Agreement unenforceable or invalid as a whole and in such event, such provision shall be changed and interpreted so as to best accomplish the objectives of such unenforceable or invalid provision within the limits of applicable law or applicable court decisions. Company agrees that upon Tester’s request, all disputes arising hereunder shall be adjudicated in the state and federal courts having jurisdiction over disputes arising in Delaware, and Company hereby agrees to consent to the personal jurisdiction of such courts. Company will not assign or transfer any rights or obligations under this Agreement without the prior written consent of Tester.  Any such assignment without prior consent shall be null and void.  Neither party shall export, directly or indirectly, any technical data acquired from the other pursuant to this Agreement or any product utilizing any such data to any country for which the U.S. Government or any agency thereof at the time of export requires an export license or other governmental approval without first obtaining such license or approval. This Agreement may be executed in one or more counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an original and all of which together shall constitute one instrument.  All notices or reports permitted or required under this Agreement shall be in writing and shall be delivered by personal delivery, electronic mail, facsimile transmission or by certified or registered mail, return receipt requested, and shall be deemed given upon personal delivery, five (5) days after deposit in the mail, or upon acknowledgment of receipt of electronic transmission. Notices shall be sent to the addresses set forth at the end of this Agreement or such other address as either party may specify in writing.

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing, of the mutual promises herein contained, and of other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged, the parties hereto, intending legally to be bound, hereby agree as follows:
1. Non-Compete Covenant
Tester acknowledges that the services to be rendered to Employer have a significant and material value to Employer, the loss of which cannot adequately be compensated by damages alone.

     A. During Tester's employment by Employer and for a period of _____ years after Tester ceases to be employed by Employer, Tester shall not within ______ miles directly or indirectly, either for Tester's own account or as a partner, shareholder (other than shares regularly traded in a recognized market), officer, Tester, agent or otherwise, be employed by, connected with, participate in, consult or otherwise associate with any other business, enterprise or venture that is the same as, similar to or competitive with Employer.

     C. During employment, and thereafter for _____ years, Tester shall not disclose to anyone any Confidential Information. For the purposes of this Agreement, "Confidential Information" shall include any of Employer's confidential, proprietary or trade secret information that is disclosed to Tester or Tester otherwise learns in the course of employment such as, but not limited to, business plans, customer lists, financial statements, software diagrams, flow charts and product plans. Confidential Information shall not include any information which; (i) is or becomes publicly available through no act of Tester, (ii) is rightfully received by Tester from a third party without restrictions; or (iii) is independently developed by Tester.
2. At Will
Tester acknowledges that Tester's employment is "at will", subject to applicable law, and that Tester Non-Compete Agreement either Employer or Tester may terminate employment at any time, with or without notice, for any reason or no reason whatsoever.

Tester covenants and agrees that, if Tester shall violate any covenants or agreements in Section 1 hereof, Employer shall be entitled to an accounting and repayment of all profits, compensation, commissions, remunerations or benefits which Tester directly or indirectly has realized and/or may realize as a result of, growing out of or in connection with any such violation; such remedy shall be in addition to and not in limitation of any injunctive relief or other rights or remedies to which Employer is or may be entitled at law or in equity or under this Agreement.

4. Reasonableness of Restrictions
     A. Tester has carefully read and considered the provisions of Section 1 hereof and, having done so, agrees that the restrictions set forth therein (including, but not limited to, the time period of restriction and the geographical areas of restriction) are fair and reasonable and are reasonably required for the protection of the interests of Employer, its officers, directors, shareholders and other Testers.
     B. In the event that, notwithstanding the foregoing, any part of the covenants set forth in Section 1 hereof shall be held to be invalid or unenforceable, the remaining parts thereof shall nevertheless continue to be valid and enforceable as though the invalid or unenforceable parts had not been included therein. In the event that any provision of Section 1 relating to time period and/or areas of restriction shall be declared by a court of competent jurisdiction to exceed the maximum time period or areas such court deems reasonable and enforceable, the agreed upon time period and/or areas of restriction shall be deemed to become and thereafter be the maximum time period and/or areas which such court deems reasonable and enforceable.
5. Burden and Benefit
This Agreement shall be binding upon, and shall inure to the benefit of, Employer and Tester, and their respective heirs, personal and legal representatives, successors and assigns.
6. Severability
The provisions of this Agreement (including particularly, but not limited to, the provisions of Section 1 hereof) shall be deemed severable, and the invalidity or unenforceability of any one or more of the provisions hereof shall not affect the validity and enforceability of the other provisions hereof.

9. Headings
The headings used herein are for the convenience of the parties only and shall not be used to define, enlarge or limit any term of this Agreement.
